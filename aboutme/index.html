    <h2> Ian Miller </h2>
    <p>Hello all! My name is Ian Miller and I'm from Mount Vernon Washington, which is famous for it's tulips.
        I am a freshman majoring in Computer Information technology, hopefully to work either in IT or Cybersecurity.
        I love to play tennis, pickleball, and the occasional videogame on the side. I love the outdoors, things like hiking, backpacking, camping, rock climbing, etc.
        My favorite scripture is Mosiah 2:41, because it reminds me to always keep the commandments because I love God and because I can expect miracles and blessings to happen in my life.
    </p>
