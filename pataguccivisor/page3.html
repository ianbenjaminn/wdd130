                    <div class="paragraph">The visor allows for the functionality of blocking out the sun from your eyes and shade on your face, all the while making sure that your flow is popping out the top, ventilated and mobile. They prevent sunburn but also allow your hair to get that extra sun-kissed summer look that everyone loves. Theyâ€™re ideal for your casual sunny day activities, like gardening, spike-ball, and everything in between. .</div>
                    <div class="paragraph">As mentioned above, the visor is designed to leave your crown wide open and allows for some major air circulation on your noggin.' You'll stay cool and look cooler while doing it. If you find that your baseball caps, trucker hats and all other sun-shade based accessories are just keeping you hot headed, you might find rocking a visor a better experience. Did we mention you'll look better too?
